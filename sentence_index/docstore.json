SEMI-BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING  \n \nThe \u2018master bedroom\u2019 next to the entrance.

No pictures \nof Ki-Tek.   \n \nEarly evening.  It\u2019s darker.  The four family members are \ngathered around a table filled with various store-bought foods.  \n \nKI-TEK\nWhat a special occasion.  The four \nof us gathered here to celebrate \nthe partial reactivation of our \nphones as well as our son\u2019s \nupcoming job interview with a \nnational franchise.  \n \nKi-Tek tries to deliver a heartfelt speech like a TV patriarch \nbut severely lacks the gravitas.

Mrs. Park wouldn\u2019t even \ntell me.  I mean, there\u2019s no \nshortage of housekeepers looking \nfor work so I guess we can just \nhire another one.  But it\u2019s a real \npity.  She was a great lady. \n \nKI-TEK\nI see. \n \nDONG-IK\nShe took care of all the little \nthings in the house.  And she was \na tremendous cook.  Most \nimportantly, she never crossed the \nline.  If there\u2019s one thing I \nhate, it\u2019s people who cross the \nline.  Well, I guess she did have \none flaw.   \n(laughs)\nShe was a big eater.  Ate twice as \nmuch as other people.

Then Dong-Ik starts laughing.  Hard.  \n \nDONG-IK\nOf course I love her!  I don\u2019t \nknow what else you\u2019d call this.   \n \nKI-TEK\nThen maybe you should look at \nthis--  \n \nKi-Tek removes a business card from his pocket and hands it to \nDong-Ik.\n \nOn beautiful ivory-colored stock, only the name, \u201cThe Care,\u201d is \nprinted in elegant typography.  No number.  No address. \n \nDONG-IK\nThe Care?  What is this?\n \nKI-TEK\nI just found out about them \nrecently too.

Except Ki-Taek, who \nwalks up to the kitchen and quietly crawls over to the \nrefrigerator.  \n \nHe sees a FAMILY PORTRAIT hanging on the kitchen wall.  A \nGERMAN FAMILY OF FOUR, white teeth shining brightly through \ntheir broad smiles.  There are more pictures on the \nrefrigerator.
